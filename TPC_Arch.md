**Senior C++ Modeling Engineer**

**What youâ€™ll be doing:**
- Investigate and propose architecture ideas based on quantitative study of existing and projected SM architecture.
- Develop performance and functional simulation models.
- Develop performance and functional testplan and tests to validate new SM architectural and features.
- Test and debug on simulators, RTL and real silicon.

**What we need to see**
- In depth knowledge of computer architecture, with good understanding of modern ISA and microprocessor implementation techniques.
- Good understanding of GPU concept and pipeline, in terms of Graphics processing and parallel compute.
- Good mastery of C++ language and at least 3 years of C/C++ development experience.
- Experience of performance/functional modelling, profiling and analysis is a plus.
- Experience with trace-driven and execution-driven simulation model development is a plus.
- BSEE, BSCSE, or equivalent required. MS or PhD is a plus.
- Candidates with GPU shader unit design, microprocessor design, and CPU/GPU performance analysis experience are preferred.

**Ways to stand out from the crowd:**
- Candidates with GPU shader unit design, microprocessor design, and CPU/GPU performance analysis experience are preferred.
